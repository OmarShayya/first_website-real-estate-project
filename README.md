# first_website-real-estate-project
Real Estate website project (NodeJS, MongoDB, EJS, CSS, JS, JQuery) 
This is a real estate website that I built in my web programming course with a period of 5 days. I used a a template for the homepage, but applied several changes. I added some back-end functions and other pages. some of the functions: login, signup and logout using ajax. Furthermore, I added an option to insert your house with description and image to mongodb database using multer, and another option to query for (my own) lands and delete from the database. Last but not least, I added an option to called view that only an admin can see and which takes him to a page here he can view all users and change their role to admin.
